## Description
*Torment characters from Greek mythology! Forever! Push Sisyphus back down the hill! Peck out Prometheus’s liver! Withhold the apple from Tantalus! Albert Camus said we must imagine Sisyphus happy! So the boulder must be even happier! Right?!*

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Inversion Edition_ is a new edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series, focusing on a retelling of five (kind of) mythological punishments. In the _Inversion Edition_ the role of the player is switched from the tormented to the tormentor, but is it really any better? Is Sisyphus happy? Is the boulder?
