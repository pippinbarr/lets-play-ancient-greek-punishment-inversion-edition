## Design

## Develop

- ~~Set up a skeleton phaser3 project~~
- ~~Add basic scene template to project~~
- ~~Add starting menu text just prove you can~~
- ~~Add basic menu interaction~~

### Sisyphus
- ~~Finish first version to point where you can use input to reverse the animation down the hill~~
- ~~Add the ending~~
- ~~__WENT WITH THE AWFUL PROCESS OF DRAWING RECTANGLES OVER IT. WORKS.__ How to indicate the "top" of the hill? (Remove in all images is a huge pain, code to draw rects over top part of the hill would work but is ugly?)~~
- ~~Separate animation elements (ala Limited Edition for efficiency and because I'll have to elsewhere)~~
- ~~Remove instructions once they've followed them and had an effect~~

- Tweak feel

## Bugs

- TTF font doesn't always display, vanishes after hard reload (no cache), drops back to Times or similar
  - Seems to rectify when you load the next scene (Sisyphus always has correct font, even when Menu doesn't)
