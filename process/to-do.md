## Design

## Develop

- ~~Set up a skeleton phaser3 project~~
- ~~Add basic scene template to project~~
- ~~Add starting menu text just prove you can~~
- ~~Add basic menu interaction~~

### Sisyphus
- ~~Finish first version to point where you can use input to reverse the animation down the hill~~
- Add the ending

## Bugs

- TTF font doesn't always display, vanishes after hard reload (no cache), drops back to Times or similar
  - Seems to rectify when you load the next scene (Sisyphus always has correct font, even when Menu doesn't)
