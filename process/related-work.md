## Texts

- _The Myth of Sisyphus_ by Albert Camus, 1942. ("One must image Sisyphus happy.")

- _Alien Phenomenology_ by Ian Bogost, 2012. (And indeed "object-oriented ontology" in general.)

- _Morphology of the Folktale_ by Vladimir Propp, 1958. (Specifically as regards the structuring of roles.)

- _Structural Semantics_ by Algirdas Greimas, 1983. (For a structural approach to roles, specifically the idea of Subject and Opponent. For a run-down see, for instance, [_The Actantial Model_](http://www.signosemio.com/greimas/actantial-model.asp) by Louis HÃ©bert)

## Film/animation

- _Sisyphus_ by Marcell Jankovics, 1974. (Very beautiful.)

## Games

- _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ by Pippin Barr, 2011. (The original!)

- _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Art Edition Edition_ by Pippin Barr, 2015.

- _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Limited Edition_ by Pippin Barr, 2016.

- _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: CPU Edition_ by Pippin Barr, 2017.

- Various other people have made versions of Sisyphus, e.g. [Sisyphus](https://gprosser.itch.io/sisyphus), [Sisyphus Reborn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/517910/Sisyphus_Reborn/), [Sisyphos](https://killscreen.com/articles/sisyphos/), and so on.

- Endless runners are not entirely dissimilar to ancient greek punishments? Nor are the various F2P games like Candy Crush, Dots, etc. etc.? What is worse, being tricked into pushing the boulder uphill thinking it's an accomplishment, or knowing you're being punished (and perhaps happy ala Camus?)
